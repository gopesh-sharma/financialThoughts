I work as a Full Stack Developer especially in .Net Core and Angular though I have also worked on Node.js and React. As a Developer, I always try to use logical, technical and analytic skills to develop and deliver the applications.

I have around 7 years of relevant experience in analysis, design, and development of web applications using the programming skills C#, ASP.Net, MVC, Angular, SSRS, SQL Server, SOLR. My interest mainly lies in products which impact masses and helps in solving real-world problems. I am open to contributing to open-source projects.

Apart from working, I like to travel and a budding photographer.
