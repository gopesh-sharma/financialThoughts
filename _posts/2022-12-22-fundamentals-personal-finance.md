You've got your budget, and you've got your savings, this is what everyone else but what else can you do? Well, how about doing some smart financial decisions that will make sure you have enough money for everything and then some? It's easy to get caught up in the day-to-day minutiae of life, but it's important to keep an eye on your finances (which is very much needed now) so that when unexpected expenses come up or opportunities arise, you're always prepared.

### Create a budget

A [budget]({% post_url 2022-12-22-creating-budget %}) is a plan for spending and saving money, this is the must have for everyone. It’s a way to manage your money so that you spend less than you earn, which helps save for retirement, pay down debt and build up an emergency fund. If you don’t have a set budget in place yet, start by creating one now! There are numberous ways you can start budgeting and in following posts we can talk about this more.

### Set aside money for emergencies

You should have a savings account that you can access quickly when an emergency comes up which in simple terms is known as Emergency Fund. If you don't, it will take longer to fix the problem and may cost more in the long run. You should try to save at least 3-6 months' worth of living expenses in your savings account so if something happens, you are ready for it. This could include paying off any debt that has accrued during that time period as well as saving up for new purchases like furniture or appliances (if necessary). It's also important not only to keep track of what money goes where but also when things happen: such as when there was an unexpected medical bill or other expense happened unexpectedly; this is why having an emergency fund helps prevent unnecessary stress on yourself throughout life! If you are a working individual having an emegency fund is very much necessary.

### Start saving and invest

- Start saving early. The power of compound interest is a powerful thing, and it's one of the best ways to build wealth over time. Though if you have not started yet, then start today. Better late than never.
- Save more than you spend. Even if you're not rich yet, it's important to save enough money so that you'll have enough funds in the bank or retirement account when times get tough (or even before). That way, if something unexpected happens—like losing your job or health insurance—you'll still be financially stable enough to handle it properly without having to worry about going into debt because all your extra cash has been spent on bills and necessities like food and gas bills first before anything else could possibly happen at this point in time right now here right now :( sorry!
- Investing doesn't always mean stocks: Investing involves buying different types of investments depending on their risk level; some options might be considered safer than others based on which assets they hold by default when compared against other assets such as bonds which tend towards fixed income products such as certificates issued by government agencies like Treasury Bills (T-Bills), Treasury Notes (T-Notes) etcetera...

### Eliminate high-interest credit card debt

- Eliminate high-interest credit card debt.
- Pay off your credit cards with a debt consolidation loan.
- Consider a balance transfer to lower interest rates and avoid paying more than you have to on loans or credit cards.
- Consider taking out a personal loan from the bank if you need money, but don't want to be responsible for repaying it until after graduation (which might be several years away). This way, you won't have great access to cash while in school—but if things go wrong financially during those years, there will be no hard feelings from the bank!

### Amass wealth and sustain it by making smart financial decisions.

As you begin to accumulate wealth and sustain it by making smart financial decisions, here are some of the most important things to remember:

- Save. Saving money is essential to building up your nest egg, but it's also important that you don't spend too much—or too little! There are plenty of ways to save money on a regular basis, whether it's through setting up automatic withdrawals from your bank account or simply putting away some cash each month.
- Invest wisely. Once you have a steady stream of income coming in each month (and maybe even more than one source), investing can be done in many different ways: buying stocks or bonds; opening an IRA; placing bets on which companies will do well in the future; whatever works best for YOU! The key thing here is not just having an opinion about what stocks are worth investing in but checking out how much risk there might be with each choice before making any real decision.

If you want to get started on your path to becoming a more financially aware person, then start with these five ways:

- Create a budget
- Set aside money for emergencies
- Start saving and invest
- Eliminate high-interest credit card debt
- Amass wealth and sustain it by making smart financial decisions.

Let's not forget the importance of having fun along the way! The more of that you have, the better.:)
