If you are having a hard time-saving money then it's time to consider the envelope budgeting method. Envelope budgeting is a simple but effective method of managing finances. In this type of budgeting method, you are setting a fixed amount of money to specific categories.

## What is Envelop Budgeting Technique?

Envelope budgeting is a simple yet very effective method of managing your finances. In this budgeting method, you will divide a set amount of money into specific categories. You will divide your income into physical envelopes (or virtual envelopes). These envelopes are labelled with different categories of expenses. The categories of expenses are groceries, entertainment or savings. The idea is that once the money in the envelope is gone, you are not allowed to spend on that category until the next period.

This method is very simple and easy to follow for people who have trouble sticking to a budget. This is because when you separate your money into different categories then you know exactly where your money is going. In this way, you can make the adjustment as and when needed.

With the envelop method, your falling victim to impulse purchases can be reduced because you will spend less money using cash.

## The best way to create an Envelope budget

Envelop Budgeting is one of the best ways to track your spending as well as control your expenses. So the best way to create the envelop budget is as follows:

1. List Income and Expense - The first step in any budgeting is to determine your income and expenses and the same applies to envelop budgeting as well. You need to list down all your monthly expenses as well as income from all the sources. Along with that list down all the irregular expenses as well.

2. Create Categories - Create categories for the budget. The categories are groceries, utilities, rent, entertainment, or savings.

3. Label Envelope - This envelope system mainly relies on cash, like creating envelop and keeping the cash in that envelope. You can also use the virtual envelope. Label the envelope with the different categories, or you can use a digital app or spreadsheet to keep track of your budget. This will help to track your spending as well as control your expenses and keep you organized.

4. Allocate Funds - It’s time to start filling the labelled envelope with cash or transferring money into the designated accounts.

5. Spend - Now you have the envelope ready and it's time to spend every day based on the money allocated to the envelope. Be sure to stick to the budget you set for each envelope, and try to avoid dipping into one envelope to cover expenses for another.

One of the biggest advantages of envelope budgeting is that it helps you stay aware of where your money is going. When you see the money physically leaving an envelope (or virtually), it becomes more real and makes it easier to stick to a budget. It also helps you to prioritize your spending. When you have a limited amount of money in each envelope, you’re forced to make conscious decisions about where to spend your money. This can help you cut back on unnecessary expenses and save more money in the long run.

It's also important to track your progress and make adjustments as needed. Review your budget and expenses regularly to see where you can cut back and where you can save more.

## How Envelope Budgeting method is compared to Other budgeting methods?

Envelope budgeting is one of the popular budgeting methods that has been used for many years. You will be allocated a set amount of money for specific expenses or categories by keeping that money in a physical or virtual envelope. However, it is not the only budgeting method available.

One of the most common budgeting methods is the [50/30/20 rule](https://www.thefinancenotes.com/budgeting/manage-money-budgeting-methods-personal-finance/). In this method, you will be dividing your post-tax income into three categories as follows: 50% for necessities, 30% for entertainment spending, and 20% for savings and debt repayment. This method is relatively simple to follow and can be a good starting point for those new to budgeting.

Another popular method is the [zero-based budgeting method](https://www.thefinancenotes.com/budgeting/zero-based-budgeting/). In this budgeting method, your income minus expenditure should be zero at the end of the month. This method can be more detailed and time-consuming, but it allows for a more accurate picture of where your money is going.

The last common method is the percentage-based budgeting method. It is like envelop budget where you will be allocating a percentage of your income to different expenses or categories. This can be a flexible way to budget, as the percentages can be adjusted as needed.

Envelope budgeting offers a hands-on and visual approach to budgeting as you can track where your money is flowing. It can help people who have trouble sticking to a budget and those who have a hard time-saving money. It has more flexibility than the 50/30/20 rule, but it is not as detailed as zero-based budgeting. It's also like a percentage-based budgeting method, but it focuses more on cash and physical allocation than on percentages.

It’s important to note that the most effective budgeting method is the one that works best for you. And it can be different for different individuals.
